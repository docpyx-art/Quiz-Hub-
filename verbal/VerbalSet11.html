    passage: `
Vadamalai Elangovan and Ganapathi Marimuthu showed that high moonlight intensity inhibits the activity of the greater
short-nosed fruit bat (Cynopterus sphinx), a result explicable in terms of benefits and costs: greater lunar intensity may
not enable the bats to increase foraging success enough to offset the higher chance of detection by predatory owls or
hawks. Most other nocturnal mammals respond to lunar intensity variations similarly to greater short-nosed fruit bats,
but mongoose lemurs (Eulemur mongoz) display the opposite pattern, as their heavy reliance on visual foraging results in
a different balance of reward and risk.

During Rome’s republican period, which ended in the first century BCE, libraries were predominantly owned by wealthy
individuals who tightly controlled access to their book collections. The first public library became available in Rome in 28
BCE and was soon followed by one commissioned by Emperor Augustus. As modern scholar Fabio Fernandes notes,
however, these two traditions aren’t as distinct as they seem, as both the emperor and the private library owners viewed
their libraries as extensions of their personal patronage, just on vastly differing scales.

more clearly, and sat down with the feeling that, for some reason which he could not grasp, his strokes had gone

• It was founded in 1841 by writer George Ripley.<br>

German theater practitioner Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956) believed that theater should elicit an intellectual rather than an
emotional response from audiences, provoking them to consider social and political realities that extend beyond the
characters and events depicted onstage. Brecht’s influence can be seen in English playwright Caryl Churchill’s 1979 play
<i>Cloud 9</i>: although the play sometimes invites empathetic reactions, it primarily works to engage audiences in an
interrogation of patriarchy and colonialism, which it does by placing audiences at a distance, thereby encouraging them

For centuries, the widespread acknowledgment of the involvement of the cerebellum—a dense brain structure in
vertebrates—in coordinating motor control in humans has hindered recognition of other possible functions of the

Dutch painters in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often showed tables filled with large wheels of cheese or
carved shards of butter. Some art historians, noting that dairy products were a major component of the Dutch diet,
interpret these depictions as reflections of everyday Dutch eating habits. However, a group of researchers recently
reviewed hundreds of food-related paintings and found that lemons—which could only be acquired in the Netherlands at
